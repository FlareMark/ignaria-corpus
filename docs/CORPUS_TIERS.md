## Integration

The Ignaria application is designed to seamlessly integrate both public and premium corpus tiers. The same metadata structure and APIs work across all tiers, allowing applications to gracefully handle different access levels.

See [SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](../SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) for technical integration details.

## Contributing

Contributions to the public tier are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

The public corpus serves as the community-maintained foundation, while premium tiers provide additional value through licensing, curation, and enhancement.
